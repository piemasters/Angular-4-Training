Create new project:
ng new project-name

Run project:
ng-serve

Updating npm:
npm install -g npm

Update angular-cli:
npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli

Generate component (while app is running):
ng generate component component-name
or
ng g c component-name
ng g d directive-name

Component selector types:
app-test   = <app-test></app-test>
[app-test] = <div app-servers></div>
.app-test  = <div class="app-test"></div>

Databinding
(event)="function()"
[property]="variable"
[(ngModel)]="variable" // Two way binding

Local reference
<p #variable></p>

String Interpolation
{{ var }}

Create a recipe-list component within the recipes folder without a testing spec
ng g c recipes/recipe-list --spec false

Angular View Encapsulation
Styles only apply to their component, not to the project.
Add the following into the component.ts:
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated - normal
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None - disables view encapsulation
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Native - uses shadowdom where supported

Lifecycle
ngOnChanges - Called after a bound input property changes
ngOnInit - Called once the component is initialized
ngDoCheck - Called during every change detection run
ngAfterContentInit - Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
ngAfterContentChecked - Called every time the projected content has been checked
ngAfterViewInit - Called after the component's view (and child views) has been initilised
ngAfterViewChecked - Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
ngOnDestroy - Called once the component is about to be destroyed

Attribute Directives
Look like a normal HTML attribute (possibly with databinding pr event binding)
Only effrect/change the element they are added to

Structural Directives (begins with a *)
Look like a normal HTML attribute but have a leading * (for desugaring)
Affect a whole area in the DOM (elements get added/removed)

Services
List a service in the providers array to use a new instance of that service.
If you don't list it in the providers array you use the shared instance.
List the service in the app.modules providers array to ensure the same
instance is used throught the app unless it is overriden.
Add @Injectable() into a service you want to inject another service into.
